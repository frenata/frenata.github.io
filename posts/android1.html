<p>Frustrated by communication issues while working on my WGU
capstone/thesis, I recently turned to the only other class I have left:
Mobile Application Development. I was fairly excited by this (I get to
build Android apps!), but the reality of the class was somewhat
intimidating. There is no objective assessment, only a performance
assessment that involves building an actual app. Fine. But provided
materials are…minimal. No problem, I thought, since android development
is so popular there should be plenty of information freely available on
the web!</p>
<p>While my original plan was to work through some of Udacity’s free
material on Android, then to launch into the class project, I realized
that the time left in my term was quickly running out. Not having time
to learn it “the right way”, I resolved to “fake it until I made it,”
passing the class, and revisiting android development proper when my
time permits. My first step was to follow a tutorial to build a working
app along similar lines to what I needed to eventually build. I pulled
from two tutorials to get the basics rolling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lynda’s <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Android-tutorials/Building-Note-Taking-App-Android/377485-2.html">Note-Taking
App</a> video tutorial, which was specifically linked on the WGU course
page</li>
<li>Vogella’s <a
href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidSQLite/article.html">Android
SQLite database tutorial</a>, which is just text and lots of code
samples, covering a variety of ways to interact with a SQLite database
in Android</li>
</ul>
<p>I primarily followed the Lynda tutorials, adjusting and learning as I
went. For instance, that tutorial uses a very simple DB table with just
two columns: the text of the note and the id (primary key) of the note.
For even the simplest of my tables I needed to store at least 4 pieces
of information: a term title, start and end dates, and the id. Thus my
app quickly diverged from the tutorial, with multiple relevant fields
complicating the layout files. To list data, android provides some basic
list layouts, but they hold only up to two pieces of info. Since I
wanted to dispaly three pieces of information, I had to build my own
custom list layout.</p>
<p>I kept the basic class structure the same, although looking forward
somewhat I seperated my <code>TermTable</code>, representing a single
SQL table, from my <code>SchedulerDBHelper</code>, which
opens/creates/upgrades the database itself, and my
<code>SchedulerProvider</code>, which is a ContentProvider to allow
“easy” access to the database. Early on, I also implemented a separate
<code>Term</code> class to handle bundling of the values from the
<code>TermTable</code> table, but I later merged these together into a
single class called <code>Term</code>, to handle all things related to a
“term”.</p>
<p>From that point on, working through the rest of the tutorials was
relatively straightforward, until I had a working app that let me
display lists of terms and edit them, all backed by a SQLite database.
But of course, this was only the beginning.</p>
