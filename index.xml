      <title>How I learned to stop worrying and love the fuzz</title>

      <description>The Mystery Fuzzing has always been shrouded in mystery to me. Throwing random data at your program and seeing how it reacts felt like something for better programmers or more industrial applications, not the relatively small things I find myself more likely to write.
This week I dipped my toes into the mysterious waters of fuzzing, stopped worrying, and learned to love what fuzzing can do: reveal bugs in even small applications.</description>

      <title>RC 0: All Talk</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure how to properly do the work of reflection while I&amp;rsquo;m at RC.
Blogposts for each day? Potentially unfocused, a lot of work to feel good about publishing to the harshness of the tubes, but easily available to family/friends/future employers.
Zulip checkins? Lack of focus isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily considered a problem, a quick bullet list is probably plenty of effort, and the audience is highly receptive&amp;hellip;but also inherently limited.</description>

      <title>Saving a partial Elm Model to LocalStorage</title>
      <link>http://frenata.me/blog/elm-localstorage/</link>

      <description>Pollution I was nearly finished building a relatively simple webapp to simulate stock trading, when a problem I had set aside from the beginning of the work came looming back: storing the data.
The app gives you some money to play with and allows you to buy and sell stocks, but the portfolio data was purely ephemeral, vanishing with a refreshed page. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense for a simulation that would most likely be used over a number of days.</description>

      <description>or, how I started getting paid to code First, a disclaimer: I make no claims to teach anyone how to Freelance successfully, despite the title. This merely chronicles my first steps into freelancing, from zero to&amp;hellip; more than zero?
0: So I wanna be a freelancer!? It&amp;rsquo;s an awkward time career-wise for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve secured some useful &amp;ldquo;credentials&amp;rdquo; and I do have some track record of employment, but not that many projects to show off to a future employer.</description>

      <title>Running a 5K: Goals</title>

      <description>I decided this week to stop haphazardly trying to get more physically fit but instead shoot for a concrete goal: running a 5K.
Physical exercise can&amp;rsquo;t be that different than mental exercise right? Having a goal and pushing towards it means miles better productivity when it comes to coding or computers. It seems logical the same must be true in other aspects of life.
I&amp;rsquo;m following a guide and have a goal race pace in mind: 30 minutes.</description>

      <description>Since finishing up at WGU, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt myself floundering for lack of structure. I was getting stuff done&amp;hellip;but it was a little bit of that, a little bit of this, ooh that looks interesting, squirrel!
I knew I needed some added structure to shape and guide my learning, but what?
This became even more relevant once I landed a couple of freelancing jobs. Huge portions of my days are spent caring for an infant, so I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to not be productive when I have the chance.</description>

      <description>Fresh Links  Deployed App GitHub repo  One Step at a Time There several features I needed to implement for this project that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done previously:
 serving actual html, rather than just instruction text or JSON responses distinguishing and using both GET and POST methods and then of course the core &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; of allowing a user to upload a file and figuring out how to extract data from that file.</description>

      <description>Fresh Links  Deployed App GitHub repo  My Kingdom for an API (that works!) By far the most complicated thing about this project was finding the right API to work with. Historical reading indicated that Google&amp;rsquo;s Image Search API had once been fairly open, but do they even pretend that their motto is &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be evil&amp;rdquo; these days?
Imgur seemed a likely candidate, but unfortunately there seemed to be no easy way to request non-album images, and no easy way to extract a direct link to the image contained in an album, and therefore no way to build thumbnail links.</description>

      <description>Fresh Links  Deployed App GitHub repo  One Repo to Rule Them All I spent a good deal of time before/during/after writing the URL shortener itself on infrastructure, so it seems reasonable to discuss it here. Working with subtrees and orphaned branches was a bit annoying on my previous speedrun attempts, and since the final objective was to unite all the projects together anyway&amp;hellip;
I decided to do it early.</description>

      <description>I was accepted to the Recurse Center a few days ago, and in the spirit of self-reflection decided to write up a little about my experiences. Since I intend to write up my experience of being there as well, it&amp;rsquo;s also just good practice.
What is RC? That turns out to a bit hard to explain, and since I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been I&amp;rsquo;m not well positioned to even try. I&amp;rsquo;ll let an alumni give it a shot though!</description>

      <title>Speedrun: Request Headers Microservice in Go</title>

      <description>Fresh Links  Deployed App GitHub repo  Wherefore art thou X-Forwarded-For? Apparently the client IP can be sent several different ways, so it was necessary to check various headers. Also along these lines, none of these headers are sent when browsing locally via heroku local, meaning the only way I could test that this was working properly was &amp;ldquo;in production.&amp;rdquo; Decidedly not ideal.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full text of my function to fetch the IP address:</description>

      <description>Why Go? Because I like it, that&amp;rsquo;s why! And it&amp;rsquo;s pragmatic but one-way-to-do-it spirit fits my personality. After spending months with Java for school it is an absolute joy to work with. I&amp;rsquo;ll touch on some of the more interesting things I encountered while working on the project. The details are in the source of course, which I worked hard to keep readable and annotated.
 Deployed App GitHub repo  Heroku I had not used Heroku previously, so I spent quite a bit of time just getting started with it.</description>

      <description>Previously After implementing a class hierarchy and a unified point of database access via a Content Provider the core mechanisms of my app were in place: the ability to do basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on the various types in my database. It was time to put the finishing touches, not all of which were trivial.
Time Keeps Ticking&amp;hellip; The first major task was to enable the user to create notifications for the various data types, most of which had date fields attached.</description>

      <description>After bulding the basics of my android app, I had a simple app that could display/edit lists of school terms. The problem? The requirements specified that the app have terms, courses associated with each term, assessments associated with each course, and notes associated with each course or assessment.
That was fine, after all I was armed with all kinds of SQL database design knowledge after 3 courses at WGU, so I rapidly stubbed out java classes for each of these entities.</description>

      <description>Frustrated by communication issues while working on my WGU capstone/thesis, I recently turned to the only other class I have left: Mobile Application Development. I was fairly excited by this (I get to build Android apps!), but the reality of the class was somewhat intimidating. There is no objective assessment, only a performance assessment that involves building an actual app. Fine. But provided materials are&amp;hellip;minimal. No problem, I thought, since android development is so popular there should be plenty of information freely available on the web!</description>

      <title>FOSSASIA: Lessons Learned</title>

      <description>What I learned from volunteering at FOSS ASIA:
 Say yes.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do that thing, be upfront about that lack, ask for advice in how to do it, then say yes anyway But don&amp;rsquo;t wait to be asked, look for a need and try to help fill it. Arriving early never hurts.  Talk about yourself.  It took me a few days to nail down a &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s who I am/what I do/what I&amp;rsquo;m interested in&amp;rdquo; routine.</description>

      <description>My first conference had gone acceptably well, but I had resolved to be better.
When the stars aligned and I was able to attend another conference this March, FOSSASIA 2017, I was better. Drawing on yet another tidbit of advice (from where I know not), I decided that rather than just buying a ticket and attending the conference I would volunteer. Ideally this would force me to engage with people rather the particulars of technical talks.</description>

      <description>Last August, at the first technical conference in my rebirthed career as a developer, I spent the entirety of the first day rushing about from session to session, taking notes about interesting ideas and spending most of the elaborate luncheon thinking about which talks I would listen to later that day. But while the tidbits of insight I gained were no doubt highly entertaining at the time, the only thing I can clearly recall 7 months later was a discussion of how Hollywood adapted its view of Computer Security over time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m diving into learning the Elastic stack: Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana. My aim is to use it to enable the local school here to extract useful information from the reams of lesson plan .docs they have laying around. Useless data right now.
There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch going on, and the actual process I&amp;rsquo;ll need to follow to ETL the data I do have into a usuable state isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely clear to me yet.</description>

      <description>After spending what seemed like the entire month of December and about half of January doing nothing but schoolwork, life is calming down. Between me and graduation are only 3 things:
 the OCP certification test a prescribed Android app project my capstone, essentially this is a senior thesis that will need to heavily emphasize the SDLC  I have plenty of time. So much so that in addition to planning to buck for a capstone excellence award, I have time and energy to devote to other things.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve pushed hard at schoolwork for the past two weeks, and a day of Rest presented itself. No new studies, no reviews, no school.
But what to do?
Polyglot that I am, the day&amp;rsquo;s learning was set aside to learn a new language: Elixir. I&amp;rsquo;ve played with some functional languages previously, notably Clojure and Rust, but neither truly caught my heart. Elixir has frequently popped up in comparison to one of my current favorites, Go, which has a somewhat similar concurrency philosophy.</description>

      <description>Less than a month has passed of my second term at WGU, and I&amp;rsquo;m just about done with my enrolled classes for the 6 month term. A couple of database classes are in hand, as is CompTIA&amp;rsquo;s Network+ certification, all that remains officially is a database adminstration class on the hairier parts of SQL.
Of course I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on stopping there. The winter school break presents me with a rare opportunity&amp;ndash;the chance to schedule certification tests during the work week without having to worry about who will take care of the baby.</description>
