<h2 id="dilemnas">Dilemnas</h2>
<p>Having finally secured a new CPU fan for my
rapidly-aging-but-still-perfectly-functional laptop, I had a choice to
make: what OS to install on it? My needs were pretty simple. Even on a
work machine, give me a terminal (preferably Alacritty), a browser
(preferably Firefox), and my trusty <a
href="https://gist.github.com/frenata/d5150712adbe5d4928361f6a991cc1f9">.tmux.conf</a>
and I’m ready to roll. But beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacking</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">hacking</a> I
wanted to expand my own learnings, so I dismissed various flavors of
Linux. I determined to go back to the BSDs, never mind that none of them
support suspend-on-lid-close. Who needs portability from an allegedly
portable device, anyway?</p>
<p>I really wanted to like OpenBSD with its “hardened by default”
stance. But more than that I wanted a system I could <em>describe in
code</em>. The benefits of “throw away and recreate it” systems have
been driven home through work: I wanted that for a personal daily driver
too. Frankly I’m just <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw&amp;t=12s">tired</a>
of setting/fixing up a system by running a series of adhoc commands. We
have better techniques for production, why not better techniques for
localhost?</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>A descriptive system: sure sounds like <a
href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> or <a
href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, right? Or docker? With k8s? Does
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve/OpenBSD">bhyve</a> do what I
want? Oh and whatever I choose, can I easily stand up virtual labs? <a
href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/#thin-jail">FreeBSD
Jails</a> looked quite interesting, but all of the documentation was
fundamentally imperative…</p>
<p>Finally I found something that really juiced my interest: Bastille,
one of many FreeBSD “jail management” tools, had developed something
called a <a
href="https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille#bastille-template">Bastillefile</a>.
Maybe I didn’t need to describe the <em>host</em> system, if everything
other than the basics was running in a version-controlled and
described-via-Bastillefile <em>jail</em>.</p>
<h2 id="trial-and-error">Trial and Error</h2>
<p>I found the documentation a little confusing (it exists in at least
three places, isn’t always consistent, and doesn’t have enough
examples), but I persisted. I couldn’t get <a
href="https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille#bastille-rdr">dynamic
redirect</a> to work. I slammed my head against getting TCP connections
to a PostgreSQL jail to work for <em>hours</em> before I figured out
that it was my <em>hosts</em>’s <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> that was the
problem. I destroyed and re-created jails too many times to count,
making sure that everything (other than the host <code>pf.conf</code>!)
was truly reproduceable. I cursed the learning curve on
<code>rc.d</code> scripting. But I finally got a working 3-tier <a
href="https://github.com/frenata/xanadu">toy application</a>
running.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-bits">Interesting Bits</h2>
<h3 id="parametrized-templates">Parametrized Templates</h3>
<pre><code>    doas bastille template khan frenata/coleridge/khan --arg db_pass=${DB_PASS}
    doas bastille template kubla-1 frenata/coleridge/kubla --arg db_pass=${DB_PASS}
    doas bastille template kubla-2 frenata/coleridge/kubla --arg db_pass=${DB_PASS}</code></pre>
<p>I needed to set a password for my database user <em>at jail creation
time</em> and hardcoding a thing screamed against all my instincts.
Fortunately <code>Bastillefile</code>s have a <code>ARG</code> command
that can accept arbitrary arguments – which can be used by other
commands but critically can be <code>RENDER</code>ed into files in the
jail. Notably files I’m copying or overlaying (I’m uncertain on the
tradeoff here) in.</p>
<p>Thus the application service:</p>
<pre><code>kubla_cmd=&quot;/usr/local/bin/kubla&quot;
kubla_env=&quot;DB_PASS=${db_pass}&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and the database bootstrap script:</p>
<pre><code>psql -U postgres -c &quot;alter user postgres password &#39;${db_pass}&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>can both be <code>RENDER</code>ed on jail-disk and specified by the
user at orchestration time.</p>
<h3 id="daemonizing-a-go-binary">Daemonizing a Go Binary</h3>
<p>This isn’t really Bastille specific, but as a FreeBSD-newbie, this
was one of the harder things to work out.</p>
<pre><code>kubla_cmd=&quot;/usr/local/bin/kubla&quot;
pidfile=&quot;/var/run/${name}.pid&quot;
command=&quot;/usr/sbin/daemon&quot;
command_args=&quot;-P ${pidfile} -r -f ${kubla_cmd}&quot;</code></pre>
<p>That collectively means: run this binary as a daemon with a
controlled PID file, restarting it as needed. The idea is that
<code>service kubla {start, stop, restart}</code> just works after
this.</p>
<p>But you also have to <em>stop</em> it properly by killing the daemon
itself:</p>
<pre><code>stop_postcmd=&quot;stop_kubla&quot;
stop_kubla()
{
    if [ -e &quot;${pidfile}&quot; ]; then
        echo &quot;stop daemon&quot;
        kill -s TERM `cat ${pidfile}`
    fi
}</code></pre>
<p>Much easier was ensuring the binary was rebuilt on restart:
<code>start_precmd="cd /src &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/go build -o /usr/local/bin/kubla ."</code></p>
<p>I might have given up and done something much hackier without <a
href="https://old.reddit.com/r/freebsd/comments/7nmrha/supervised_freebsd_rcd_script_for_a_go_daemon/">reddit</a>,
and I’m sure this isn’t selling anyone on the glories of
<code>rc.d</code> over <code>systemd</code>. It’s… livable.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>In the end I accomplished <em>some</em> of what I wanted. I had
reproduceable services on my host, and hit (and learned from) several
FreeBSD-related snags: <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>rc.d</code>. But I
didn’t configure my host – only a set jails for a sample application.
I’d gone down a production-oriented path rather than a
localhost-oriented one, despite my intentions.</p>
<p>But using (apparently?) the same mechanisms, the excellently named <a
href="https://github.com/BastilleBSD/rocinante">rocinante</a> appears
promising, should I choose to stay on the BSD-ish path. Other things
irritated me and left me with questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Setting up some of these jails was pretty slow due to the large
number of dependencies. For instance the <code>kubla</code> template is
intended to be run as a cluster of servers – I can imagine auto-scaling
this cluster and would want to minimized time from
<code>bastille create</code> to a running server. Is there an easy way
to create layers/checkpoints/bootstraps to save time?</li>
<li>I don’t love setting hardcoded IPs. Is there a way to just hand out
ranges and let the management system figure it out? In my toy, only one
IP/port needed to even be exposed to the host. Ideally I’d want the
connectivity between jails also expressed, in a way that means I don’t
have to learn a bunch of <code>pf.conf</code> or do adhoc things on the
host.</li>
<li>Is jail startup or dependency <a
href="https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille/issues/577">orderable</a>?
Or is this an XY question and a properly designed system would be robust
to failure?</li>
<li>What about more complex <a
href="https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille/issues/609">orchestration</a>?
Across hosts? With auto-scaling? While I could hack more stuff together
via <code>Makefile</code>, it’s… not ideal.</li>
</ol>

<li><a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LinuxJails">LinuxJails</a>, for
things where software doesn’t (conveniently) run on FreeBSD?</li>
<li><code>rocinante</code></li>
<li>Look at the Nomad/Pot driver and see how easily it could be adapted
for <code>bastille</code></li>
<li>PR some documentation fixes</li>
